# openpilot External Radar Addon

## Overview
This project enables sensor fusion in openpilot by integrating an external radar. The radar is mounted on the windshield and connected to the vehicle's OBD2 port for both power and signal transmission. With openpilot also connected to the OBD2 port, it can read radar data, enhancing its perception capabilities.

## Why This Project?
Some vehicles with openpilot installed can only use Vision-Only Adaptive Cruise Control (VOACC). By adding an external radar to the car, sensor fusion enables more accurate lead car speed detection and distance measurement, significantly improving safety and performance.

**The guide and code are designed for Toyota vehicles**. If using a different vehicle, you will need:
   - Modify the code to use the correct CAN channel.
   - Adjust the distance from the vehicle front to the radar if mounting in front of the vehicle.
   - Ensure CAN message compatibility to avoid conflicts with the vehicle's existing communication.

## Prerequisites
Before installing this addon, ensure you have the following:
- A car that already has openpilot installed.
- The car must support openpilot longitudinal control.
- The car does not have radar support. (e.g. Nissan, Volkswagen, Mazda, Subaru...)
- A comma 3 or 3X device.
- A comma 3 or 3X running **openpilot version 0.9.8 or above**.
